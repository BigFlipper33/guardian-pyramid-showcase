# Project Status — Guardian Pyramid

## Current State
**Production-ready prototype**

Guardian Pyramid has progressed beyond proof-of-concept and operates as a stable, integrated embedded system validated on physical hardware.

---

## System Maturity
- Firmware architecture: **Stable**
- Core functionality: **Implemented**
- Hardware integration: **Validated**
- Power and timing behavior: **Tuned**
- User interaction: **Reliable**

The system is capable of repeatable operation without intervention.

---

## Scope Confirmation

The scope of Guardian Pyramid is intentionally fixed.

The product:
- Operates using predefined modes
- Provides coordinated motion and lighting
- Responds to physical user input
- Prioritizes reliability over expansion

No additional features are required to consider this version complete.

---

## Known Constraints
- Firmware is deployed via wired flashing
- OTA updates are not enabled in this version
- Hardware layout may evolve for manufacturability
- Certain configuration values are intentionally fixed

These constraints are deliberate and aligned with product stability.

---

## Future Work (Non-Exhaustive)

- Optional OTA update support
- Additional operational modes
- Manufacturing-oriented refinements

Details are maintained privately.
